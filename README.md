# Java-Mini-Projs

## What to do:
- If you are more beginner, or want a solid OOP focus, start with Garage, as the task was originally designed to help core OOP structure in a simple way
- If you find that a bit simple, do the Banking exercise, as its core focus is OOP but implements things that you have learned on this course
- If you are more advanced, have a go at the Task and budget task, as this implements lots of more technical topics, and has lots of extra things to include like testing and JDBC
